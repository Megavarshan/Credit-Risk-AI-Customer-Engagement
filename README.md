# Intelligent Fintech Operations: Integrating Credit Risk Assessment and AI-Powered Customer Engagement Overview
This project aims to develop an integrated system for fintech excellence, leveraging advanced technologies to enhance operational efficiency and customer engagement. 

The system combines:

Credit Risk Assessment: Utilizes machine learning models to assess credit risk based on customer data.
General AI Applications: Employs natural language processing (NLP) models for automated email handling, response generation, and transaction insights.
Features
Credit Risk Assessment:

Trains a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict creditworthiness using historical customer data.
Provides evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
General AI Applications:

Classifies incoming emails into categories (e.g., account updates, transaction inquiries, password resets) using a BERT-based NLP model.
Generates context-aware responses for customer emails based on their classification.
Analyzes simulated transaction data to derive insights such as average transaction amount, fraud cases, and transaction clusters using KMeans clustering.
